# Introduction

> Spec-Driven Development flips the script on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

In this tutorial, we will explore Spec-Driven Development using [Speckit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#-what-is-spec-driven-development)

# Task
- Install Speckit by following the instructions in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#1-install-specify-cli)
- Create a new folder outside of this repository 
- Follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#-get-started) to create a simple Speckit project. You can either think of a simple application on your own or recreate the application described in the Readme.md of this repository.
